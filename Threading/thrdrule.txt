     Threading

       in all application we are thinking in terms of single
       path of execution.

      means every thing will be carried out one by one step after
      step.


     but upon a time u may feel  that if two parts of our      application run simultaneously then performance will get
    enhanced.

     (when size of application is big)
     (big in terms of no. of functionally independent modules
      present in same applicaiton)

      e.g -- word -- typing + printing

     in terms of an  c# applicaiton program think in following     manner  what if two for() loops starts working together

    for the same c# support multithreading.
 
    Thread is always there in ur application.

    means main() is also as thread which get created automatically
   when we start our c# application.

   now we will try to create our own thread and start them explicitly.

   lets identify some basic operation of Thread
        1. create a thread
        2.  start a thread
       3.   define working of thread.
       4. as after getting started thread will going to impart his            working.

      5.  we can suspend / sleep a thread

      6. we can stop a thread.

    for all these operations we get built in function which are
    collectively present in Thread class

    Thread class is present in   System.Threading namespace.
