 Multitasking :
  ability of  operating system to executed more then one task simultaneously is known as multitasking.

   all modern  o/s  supports concept of multitasking.
             e.g   lynix /  window / apple mac  etc.
             e.g  we can run n number of sessions of   internet explr concurrently or can play winamp or                    printing on cncurnt basis

     using  concept of  multitasking  we can exploit cpu time in more efficient manner.
     multitasking can be thinked as one of the feature of  o/s  .

     o/s  achv  multitasking by using concept of  time slicing....  
        i.e using single processor   o/s  manage execution of  n number of  task simultaneously.

      Multitasking  is again can be of  2 types : 
                          Process based multitasking       Thread based      multitasking.
       in case of  Process based multitasking  o/s will manage execution of  each process in seperate - 2        address space
       
        where as in case of  Thread based multitasking  o/s can   manage multiple task with in single         address space

         process based multitasking best suitable when 2 process do not need  resource sharing
         where as if  each process need data of  each other then such kind of  communication of data                  results in  speed degradation.   to resolve above prob o/s  purpose  Thread based multitasking.

          e.g  of Process based multitasking are  execution of   winamp +  intrnt explr +  mspaint
          Thread based  multitasking   are   execution of   multiple threads running with in Word application     
                                                                                                     spell chkr  +  word printing + word typing.
           now   with in a java application  we try to implmtn  Thread based multitasking.   MultiThreading  or 
           Multithreaded  programming.
